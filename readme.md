This is a quick deployment, totally temporary, and a total work in process. More info soon.

*Note*
- We're using the a Git submodule to sync styles in the `/styles/` folder. Read more here: [git submodule.](https://blog.github.com/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/)
- The `/email/` folder has inlined HTML - and we are compiling the css/scss files (and the excitingly awesome json) for each email template. Because this is cut out of the current `dank` system we are building with, if you want to maintain using the css/scss files, I'd suggest compiling with the local [Sass compiler] (https://sass-lang.com/).
